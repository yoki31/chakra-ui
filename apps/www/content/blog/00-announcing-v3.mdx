Today, we're excited to announce the long-awaited release of Chakra UI v3.0.

This release is made possible by the hard work of the Chakra UI team and the
community feedback from the preview releases.

Chakra v3 is built on top of Ark UI, our headless component library. It also
adapts the new theming API from Panda CSS, making our overall ecosystem more
coherent and easier to use.
